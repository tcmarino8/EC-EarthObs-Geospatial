# EC-EarthObs-Geospatial
This is some of the extracurricular work I have toyed around with with respect to Earth observation and Geospatial data analysis. 

I use google earth engine translated from Javascript into Python using the gee package to analyze satellite images, tracking evolution of a space's attributes over time.
I use folium to plot maps of key points.
I have written a webscraper to pull all locations of a toy company Compass Real estate.
I wrote a program to convert a geojson geodataframe, written as a csv into a geodataframe. I.e. the column of geometries, initially a string will be turned into a column of geometries of the correct form.

Along with other projects relating to census track data observation, street map and open source city data.
